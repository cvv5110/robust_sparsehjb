\section{Probabilistic Robust Control}

A probabilistic approach which exploit the domain and distribution of the uncertain model parameters is developed for the design of robust feedback controllers. A polynomial chaos expansion is used to represent uncertain system states and cost functions in terms of finite-dimensional series expansion in the stochastic space.
